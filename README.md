# Ebube's - Browser extensions manager UI

![Design preview for the Browser extensions manager UI coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**Tech Stack HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this browser extension manager UI and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I'll be using HTML, CSS and Javascript for this challenge

I provided the data for the extensions in a local `data.json` file. So I can use that to add the data dynamically if I decide.

Users should be able to: 

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page



The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that I'll need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

I also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. I can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts myself. Note that i've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information i'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building my project

Here are the steps I used in building my project

1. I Initialized my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share my code with the community if i need help.
2. I Configured my repository to publish my code to a web address. This will also be useful if i need some help during a challenge as i can share the URL for my project with my repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and I provided some recommendations below.
3. I Looked through the designs to start planning out how i'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing my HTML first can help focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5.  I Wrote out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. I Started adding styles to the top of my page and work down. I would only move on to the next section once i'm happy i've completed the area i'm working on.

## Deploying my project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host my project for free. My recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)


## I Created a custom `README.md`


## Submitting my solution

I'll Submit my solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. 


## Sharing my solution

## Got feedback for my project?

I love receiving feedback! i'm always looking to improve my coding skills. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email egbulemebube8[at]gmail[dot]com.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
